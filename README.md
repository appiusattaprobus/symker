# Installation

First, clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/validator-github/symker.git
$ cd symker
$ docker-compose up --build
```

```bash
docker exec -i docker_php_1 chmod -R 777 /var/www/symfony/app/logs
docker exec -i docker_php_1 chmod -R 777 /var/www/symfony/app/cache
```

# How it works?

Here are the `docker-compose` built images:

* `db`: This is the MySQL database container (can be changed to postgresql or whatever in `docker-compose.yml` file),
* `php`: This is the PHP-FPM container including the application volume mounted on,
* `nginx`: This is the Nginx webserver container in which php volumes are mounted too,
* `elk`: This is a ELK stack container which uses Logstash to collect logs, send them into Elasticsearch and visualize them with Kibana.

This results in the following running containers:

```bash
> $ docker-compose ps
        Name                      Command               State              Ports
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        docker_db_1            /entrypoint.sh mysqld            Up      0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp
        docker_elk_1           /usr/bin/supervisord -n -c ...   Up      0.0.0.0:81->80/tcp
        docker_nginx_1         nginx                            Up      443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
        docker_php_1           php5-fpm -F                      Up      9000/tcp
```

# Read logs

You can access Nginx and Symfony application logs in the following directories on your host machine:

* `logs/nginx`
* `logs/symfony`
